# CourseProject

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:  
	<ul><li>Downloads data set if it does not exist.  </li>
	<li>Unzips the data set if not already done.  </li>
	<li>Load all the datasets, including activity, features, test data and train data.  </li>
	<li>Extracts only mean and standard deviation measurements.  </li>
	<li>Merge test and train data.  </li>
	<li>Provides descriptive column names to the data set.  </li>
	<li>Creates the final data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  </li></ul>
The end result is stored as finaltidydata.txt
